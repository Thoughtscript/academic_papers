# Three Stages

In the past it has been said:

1. Attributed to Schopenhauer:

"All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident."

2. Hegel:

Thesis, Antithesis, Sublation

3. Henceforth:

The Logic of an Idea, Computational Implementation, Manifestation in Reality
