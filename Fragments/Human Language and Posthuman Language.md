# Metaphors, Math, and Semantics

Wittgenstein famously "threw away the ladder" due to difficulties with the traditional conception of language's relationship to the world (via transcendental and, on his view, contradictory metaphysical relationships).

1. What about Posthuman languages that are not restricted in the same manner as human languages (assuming his critique of language was correct - he came back later and argued that meaning in language dervies from *language games* and their attendant *forms of life* usually enshrined in *meaning as use theories*)? Where Wittgenstein saw a ladder to be disposed of, perhaps there's a skyhook?

1. The metaphors that are at play in depicting these simple relationships (though riddled with metaphysical worries as they might be) give rise to powerful mathematical structures. Might we borrow heavily from well-established maths to define these metaphors more fully? In doing so, the simple arrows or other symbolic representation systems at use in such discussions might give way to powerful new ways of thinking about things - ways that are indeed quite counter-intuitive to the arm-chair philosopher not acquainted with them. Pointing relations (how reference and correspondance are usually thought of)? But these mappings can be conceived even if we give a metaphysical gloss (reminded here of Carnap's distinctions between different uses of the word "exists") that cannot be sustained under scrutiny.
