# Replies to the Argument from evil

Original argument:
```
(*) God is all good, all powerful and all knowing.
(1) Any all good being would eliminate all evil.
(2) Any all powerful being could eliminate all evil.
(3) Any all knowing being knows about all evil.
(C1) Therefore, any all good, all powerful and all knowing being could, would, knows how to eliminate all evil.
(C2) Therefore, if there is evil in the world, there is no God.
```

The Free-Will defense by Plantinga:
```
(1) In order for there to be good, there must be free-will.
(2) Therefore, premise (1) in the previous argument is false.
(C) Therefore, (C2) in the previous argument does not follow.
```

Evolutionary Defense by Me:
```
(1) In order for something to be good, it must get better over time.
(2) In order to get better over time requires a contrast, dual opposite, or a complement.
(3) Therefore, premise (1) in the first argument is false.
(C) Therefore, (C2) in the first argument does not follow.
```

Evil exists (since it must so for their to be Good) and persists but diminishes over time.

Weaker Argument by Me:
```
(1) In order for something to be good, it requires a contrast, dual opposite, or a complement.
(2) Therefore, premise (1) in the first argument is false.
(C) Therefore, (C2) in the first argument does not follow.
```

Evil exists (since it must so for their to be Good) but might disappear completely over time.

Evil is required at the start to contrast with The Good.
