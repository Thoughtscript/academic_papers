# Thinking Notation

Updated: 11.18.2018

Consult Frege - but this, here, is not a work attempting to formalize logic mathematically or for use in mathematical proof or justification. 

## Simple Outline from 2012

I will depict through several axioms a few kinds of thinking (techniques) that when combined with other formal systems, imbue them with richer power:

1. I will use a few simple diagrammatic objects (in a way amenable to axiomatic approaches):

    * `@`, `>`, `^` - these symbols represent a **item of thought** (which is quite approximate but will suffice). 
    * `|` - denotes a temporal **transition in thinking**.
    * Thus, `> | >` represents the same **item of thought** over a single transitions. The same symbol on both sides of the `|` specify the same **item of thought**
    * Other marks will be introduced as well, specific to the exact operation axiomatized.
1. These diagrammatic objects can concatenated (combined) to form streams of thinking.

## Axioms

1. **Identity** - *to hold the same thing in mind across transforation* -  `> | >` 
1. **Specificity** - *to clarify and expand a thing in the mind* - `> | @ - ^`
    * "The house on the street" - "the dining room is next to the front entrance in that house on the street".
    * Here the `-` represents a relational symbol.
1. **Abstraction** - *to blur or obfuscate the details of something* - `@ - ^ | >`
1. **Seperation** - *to isolate or compartmentalize two items* - `@ - ^ | @ ^`
1. **Replacement** - *to replace one symbole for another via substitution* - `> | @`
