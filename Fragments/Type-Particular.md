Type-Particular Absorption:

x el S
Px
~(Px -> Sx || Sx -> Px)

Empirically: 
(1) Sx correlates highly with Px 
(2) ~All x el S (Px)

Tendencency, particularly during heightened anger to implicitly deny - anger negates the rational constraints on (2).

Furthermore, If most Sx are Qx : Px -> Qx.

These different properties are collapsed and illegitimately assigned to each other.
