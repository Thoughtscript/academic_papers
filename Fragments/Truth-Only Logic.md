# Truth-Only Logic

1. A set of Truth-Values [T1, T2, T3, ..., TN].
1. T1 < T2 < T3 < ... < TN - Horn ordering.
1. A set of WFF in L. 

There are no falsehoods only truths. 

Some truths contain more information - are more comprehensive truths.

This is a Zero-Order Monadic Logic. 

Aiming for a first Zero-Order "Single-Valued" Logic (beyond the trivial logic with only T and not T and F)

Expressions with Truth-Values T1, T2 would concatenate into expression of T3+.

Applications to dimensional and hyper-dimensional logics.
