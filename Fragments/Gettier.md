Basically, Gettier drew attention to cases of epistemic luck - you have a *justified true belief* but it isn’t knowledge, you were just lucky.

To further explicate this - if you saw a cow (that kinda resembled a huge boulder) and said on the basis of seeing that cow, “hey there’s a boulder over there” it’s possible, according to Gettier, that that can be a true knowledge claim. If there really is a boulder over there behind the cow (that you didn’t notice).

This famously knocked out 2,000 years of unchallenged Platonic orthodoxy about knowledge (or thereabouts).

Gettier said there needs to be some other condition besides truth, belief and justification. I think there are several proposals involving counter-factuals, relevance or contextual semantics, etc.

Here, I’ll try to tease out some of my limited thoughts about this.

First, there’s an element of mere coincidence. There’s also some kind of trickery involved (a barn, a cow) in the story such that the claim to knowledge is made on the basis of a false but closely approximate appearance. The appearance itself is what the person makes the basis of their the lucky claim to knowledge.

So, we at least know what the high-level truth-conditions entail but that doesn’t tell us what thta amounts to. There’s no explanation yet. The fourth condition will rule out these claims to knowedge whenever they are made on the basis of a closely approximate and mere coincidence.
