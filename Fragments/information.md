# Producing Value in Information Intensive Societies

Some basic categories of value:

1. *Better information* - more recent, more comprehensive, more precise, more accurate, etc.
1. *Dependent integrated information* - the information is valuable only insofar as some integrated operation or service is also acquired. The service or operation is valuable in its own right. The service or operation cannot be used without the information.
1. *Hierarchical information* - some Horn ordering exists to produce information that's inherently ordered by some dimension of value. Clarity, simplicity.
1. *Perspectival information* - information distributed according to a particular subjective or interpretive lens. Translation, emotional content, opinion editorials, etc.
1. *Credentialization* - a required normative component that certifies someone as a knowledge expert.
1. *Good information* - see other document.
1. *Dialectical information* - information in one of the other categories here that by its nature produces more information. Rhetoric, argumentation, etc. where there's at least one clear "winner" or "loser".
1. *Organizational information* - information that organizes other kinds of information.
1. *Frameworks* - systems of coordinated and coordinating information markers. Using these frameworks produce specific kinds of information as an output.

Meta-value:

Meta-information is not merely duplication of some information at a "lower level". It can produce novel insights. Meta-information, for example, can frame lower-order information in an entirely new way. Thus, information that's valuable on its own, gets repackaged, reanalyzed, reassesed in novel ways through higher-level informational structures.

1. Today is a beautiful day.
1. Language is an expressive medium.
1. Natural language is characterized by generative rules.

I can use the third, higher-level meta-information (meta-linguistic) understanding to frame both the first two informational data points (which by themselves express specific kinds of information of an entirely different nature). For example, I can **parse** the first two expressions to have a deeper understanding of their grammatical form, etymology, etc.

The third expression is created from multiple lower-level expressions that come together to produce an additive system - greater than the inputted information.
