# Possible Worlds Semantics By Way of Symmetry Groups

Closest operator in David Lewis:

See Kit Fine - Supervaluationism which demonstrates the total ordering of specification spaces (e.g. total models) or slightly weaker for partial models

Thus an effective procedure exists to verify possible worlds and we can reframe possible worlds as (symmtery groups) or (groups under transformation and symmetry breaking).

This gives rise to an a priori confirmation of certain interesting empirical discoveries regarding Initial Conditions.
