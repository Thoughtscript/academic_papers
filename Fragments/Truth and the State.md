It's interesting to think about the many dimensions of *philosophy* (the activity), it's many historical roles (priests of the ancient Greek religions, magi or state intelligence, kingmakers, academic founders, kings, military leaders, justifiers of ideologies, and so on), and the many dimensions of a single *philosophy*.

When we think of recent "philosophies" (I use quotes here since they have not been defended in professional philosophy but rather have come into parlance elsewhere) like "Post-truth" we see at once the many dimensions at play:

1. For despotic leaders, an ideology masking lies or falsehoods is quite useful.
1. From a national security or military standpoint create a shield of misinformation can be at times useful (the U.S. invasion of Normandy in 1944 was presaged by numerous intelligence feints).
1. Inaccurate demographic data leading up to the election through polled telephone calls. Called people may simply have misrepresented their true beliefs and intentions.

Three dimensions to a poorly articulated philosophy in use. And, we see the immense impact that such a poorly articulated and undesireable "philosophy" has had. 

What about more famous philosophies? Are they to be read solely from a historical lens? Solely from a cultural critique lens? Solely from a descriptive lens - (i.e. as an assertion of facts about the world)?

I argue not. Beliefs and the reasons they come into being and persist are due to many causes and from the sophisticated intersection of many intentions and plans.

## The State

Consider the notion of Truth (capital T). What dimensions does it play? Clearly there is something like Truth regardless of what we call it or what we disagree about some conception of it (the act of disagreement involves just that notion in the first place). 

But, Truth is essential to Justice, to Religion, to Military planning. It is quite difficult to implement a campaign without it (of any kind). It is also difficult for one's enemies to mount a threat if they are deprived it too.

Nietzsche said, "Everything the State says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen." 

Of course, every German soldier marched off to the First World War with a copy of his book in knapsack. (Of course, horribly altered by his sister and used to justify the expansion of the Second and Third German Reichs).

We also forget that administration and management involves handling of information just as much as it involves coordinating currencies or determining plans (all of which involve Truth). 

The ancient Greek philosophers were priests of the State Religion, advisors to the myriad Greek kings, and military intelligence officials (transferring suggestions through their cryptic Oracle) of the Polis.

The motto of the CIA is "The Truth Shall Set You Free".

John chapter 18, verse 38 of the Gospel of John, is often referred to as "jesting Pilate" or "What is truth?", of Latin Quid est veritas? In it, Pontius Pilate questions Jesus' claim that he is "witness to the truth" (John 18:37).

There's another translation "No, what is reality - it is I" - contrasting the Truth as presented by / uniform message of the Roman State against the Divine Reality espoused by Christ.
