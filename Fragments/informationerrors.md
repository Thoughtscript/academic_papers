## Lossy Compression

*Oversimplifying a concept*. Suppose you have two concepts C1 and C2 where C2 is taken to be a simpler way of explain C1.

Unless exactly all and only the content in C1 is expressed in C2, C2 is **lossy** - a surrogate.

*Appropriate simplifying* a concept is strictly to explain C1 in fewer terms while completely capturing all the semantic content of C1.

Consider two concepts:

1. **Science**
1. **Research**

**Science > Research** since **Research** is part of the activity of **Science** but **Science** is also many other kinds of activities too.

Thus, to say "Science is Research" is *Oversimplifying the concept* in a **lossy way**. It might be convenient to say or interesting as a turn of phrase but if the intent is to teach the concept of Science, the **lossy** approach is wholly inadequate.

"Research is a major part of science. So is verifying that research. Scientists formulate ideas into rigorous theories that are tested using powerful mechanical and intellectual tools..."
