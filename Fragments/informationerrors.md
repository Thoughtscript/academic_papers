## Lossy Compression

*Oversimplifying a concept*. Suppose you have two concepts *C1* and *C2* where *C2* is taken to be a simpler way of explain *C1*.

Unless exactly all and only the content in *C1* is expressed in *C2*, *C2* is **lossy** - a surrogate.

*Appropriately simplifying* a concept is strictly to explain *C1* in fewer terms while completely capturing all the semantic content of *C1*.

Consider two concepts:

1. **Science**
1. **Research**

**Science > Research** since **Research** is part of the activity of **Science** but **Science** is also many other kinds of activities too.

Thus, to say "Science is Research" is *oversimplifying the concept* in a **lossy way**. It might be convenient to say or interesting as a turn of phrase but if the intent is to teach the concept of Science, the **lossy** approach is wholly inadequate.

"Research is a major part of science. So is verifying that research. Scientists formulate ideas into rigorous theories that are tested using powerful mechanical and intellectual tools..."

This is not to break a complex concept down into parts where:

1. *C1* is broken down into *C2, C3, C4, ..., CN*.
1. *C2, C3, C4, ..., CN* are jointly equivalent in meaning to the semantic content of *C1*.
