# Skeptical Probabilities

Term keyworded. Some previous literature uses this phrase for other discussions about philosophical skepticism.

Please avoid **overnaming** here.

Calculating the credibility of philosophical positions by the number of bullshit moves required to justify it.

1. X draws squiggly marks "///".
1. X claims that "///" reveals some powerful mathematical insight.
1. X lacks a clear formal definition for "///".
1. X cannot link "///" through translation rules to any known math system.

Interrogator asks:

1. Why is that "///" allowed?

The reply:

1. Math has no justification. [Increment bullshit counter by one.]

Interrogator replies:

1. But that doesn't justify your argument, if anything it only substantiates the need for it.
1. So why should we believe your "///"?

The reply:

1. Because I created a math system. [Increment bullshit counter by one.]

Interrogator replies:

1. But that's the point, you haven't justified your claim that it is *really* a mathematical system.

Etc.

We can then calculate by indexing or comparing the bullshit counter to other and other more credible theories.

We can track truth not only via how well a positioned is argued (i.e. by what reasons it overcomes or the validity of the syntactic and semantic form it uses). We can also track the argument by the number of bullshit moves are made in (further) justifying those premises.

## Connection Theory

I argue that if existing mathematical theories X can be recapitulated (expressed) within another theory T, then T is justified. 

That line of argument was used to substantiate the use of Set Theory (Number Theory can be expressed cleanly within it). It **both** serves to delimit mathematical proof (other areas of math ultimately must express their work in ZFC Set Theory) but also generates mathematical proofs (in that one may start with Sets as defined by ZFC Set Theory to drive research).

It is my hope that the argument so given provides a degree of justification for Connection Theory when the time comes (nascent as it is). Criticisms about the craziness of my view anticipated and duly-noted per the above.
