# Thinking Notation #2

## Extension: Types or Categories

**Type** - `@ % | @%` - `%` and `@` belong to the same category and are placed adjacently.
**Grouping** - `@% | x` - `x` is the name for the category to which `%` and `@` belong.

# Alternative: Picture-Based Programming

**Linguistic frontend** to abstract or simplify simple programmatic operations using some high or low-level programming language as a **linguistic backend**.

Images or pictures (hieroglyphics) can be run through a ML library (via subscription services) to execute functions locally or externally. These can be color-coded (color-based programming) and need not be **graphs** (connected diagrams). Such images or pictures would be analogous to punch-cards in older vacuum-base machines.

The images could correspond to a model type (see "LOG").
