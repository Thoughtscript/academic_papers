# Thinking Notation #2

Building off the simple idea earlier... 12.14.18-12.15.18.

## Extension: Types or Categories

8. **Type** - *specifies a category or typing shared between two items of thought* - `@ > | @>` - `>` and `@` belong to the same category and are placed adjacently.
9. **Grouping** - *gives a handle, monniker, or label to a category* - `@> | ^` - `^` is the name for the category to which `>` and `@` belong.

## Extension: Sublation

Where two diametrically opposed items are demonstrated to be:

1. A pseudo-conflict - the two items are semantically meaningless (vacuous) or irrelevant.
1. Demonstrated to be the same item upon further examination.
1. Are discarded in favor of third item that bears some features of both previous items.

See: Hegel and Logical Modules.

# Alternative: Picture-Based Programming

**Linguistic frontend** to abstract or simplify simple programmatic operations using some high or low-level programming language as a **linguistic backend**.

Images or pictures (hieroglyphics) can be run through a ML library (via subscription services) to execute functions locally or externally. These can be color-coded (color-based programming) and need not be **graphs** (connected diagrams). Such images or pictures would be analogous to punch-cards in older vacuum-base machines.

The images could correspond to a model type (see "LOG").

Job creating:

1. Does not displace programmers.
1. Creates new standards and conventions.
1. Creates a new layer to programming and software activities
1. Broadens the user base of languages.
1. Creates a new layer between **linguistic frontends** and **linguistic backends** that can process images, pictures, colors, sounds, whatever, etc.
