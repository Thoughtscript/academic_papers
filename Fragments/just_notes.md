## Generic Just Distribution

First Wave - Distributed per the following (in no particular order):

1. Those who have sacrificed for society.
1. A purely random lottery drawing.
1. Those who have achieved greatly in terms of benefit to society.
1. Those who are in dire need.
1. Those who have experienced terribly bad luck or misfortune.
1. Those who aide in distributing in following waves or who improve the mechanism of distribution. 

## Just Dessert

A core criteria on our concept of Justice is the concept of Fairness. 

Most philosophers disagree on what constitutes a Fair system. See: Rawls and Veil of Ignorance. Nozick and Libertarianism.

I'd like to also argue that essential to Fairness is the concept of Just Dessert - *that each gets according to what they deserve*.

What people deserve is a baseline mitigated by their actions. The baseline offsets badluck or misfortune.

## Equality

Political and economic equality have often borne an element of dogmatism (and have been often conflated with mathematical identity - a different concept altogether).

Political equality means that all subjects of a system of laws are bound by exactly the same laws and treated no differently (*de jure*) by them.

Political equality has therefore contained two fundamental assumptions:

1. The Floor - some minimum standard gauaranteed for all.
1. The Ceiling - some maximal standard none may supercede.
