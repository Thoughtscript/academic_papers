## Generic Just Distribution

First Wave - Distributed per the following (in no particular order):

1. Those who have sacrificed for society.
1. A purely random lottery drawing.
1. Those who have achieved greatly in terms of benefit to society.
1. Those who are in dire need.
1. Those who have experienced terribly bad luck or misfortune.
1. Those who aide in distributing in following waves or who improve the mechanism of distribution. 

## Just Dessert

A core criterion on our concept of **Justice** is the concept of **Fairness**. 

Most philosophers disagree on what constitutes a **Fair** system. See: Rawls and the *Veil of Ignorance* argument for the Welfare State. Nozick and Libertarianism.

I'd like to also argue that essential to **Fairness** is the concept of **Just Dessert** - *that each gets according to what they deserve*.

What people deserve is a baseline mitigated by their actions. The baseline also offsets badluck or misfortune.

## Equality

Conceptions of political and economic equality have often borne an element of dogmatism (and have been often conflated with mathematical identity - a different concept altogether).

Political equality is taken to mean that all subjects of a particular system of laws are bound by exactly the same laws and treated no differently (*de jure*) by them. Perhaps some elements of common law exist to provide for *de facto* variation.

Political equality has therefore contained two fundamental assumptions:

1. The Floor - some minimum standard gauaranteed for all.
1. The Ceiling - some maximal standard none may supercede.

The *Egalitarian Impulse* recommends a universal system of political equalities enshrined in **Floors** and **Ceilings**.

## A Hypothetical Alternative

I am not advocating this as a preferred system here.

An alternative arrangement would be one in which all people were gauranteed certain basic rights satisfactory to political freedom, happiness, and security. Such rights would also entail meeting basic material needs (food, etc.). Voting would ostensibly be a right. No rights would be dependent on hereditary or contingent no-control factors like race, gender, etc. 

Upon satisfactory service to the political economy, a citizen would earn three-times the voting clout and other amenities in return and as a reward for their service. At another level, a citizen would earn ten-times the voting clout, and so on.
