# Overnaming

**Overnaming** is a fallacy.

A person *P* commits **overnaming** whenever:

1. S(X) =df D 

   Where *S* is a name used in an expression (the left-hand side) containing *X* and *D* the definition for *X*.

1. *P* believes that the meaning of *X* is *S*, not *D*.

"Overnaming means to give too many pets names..."
