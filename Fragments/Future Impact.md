The "Late Bloomer" or "Dark Horse" Hypothesis:

We usually *underestimate* the time and cost required to bring a predicted innovation or technology about.

But when that innovation or technology does arrive, we usually find ourselves having (vastly) *underestimated* its impact, power, or effect.

All together:

"We usually underestimate both (a) the time and cost required to bring a technology or innovation about and (b) the eventual impact, power, or effect of that technology or innovation when it is finally achieved."
