(*S*) If the Republicans won the election, Reagan did [won].

(*Indicative*) P => Q

Gibbard asserts that Indicative Conditionals either collapse into the Material Conditional (of classical logic) 
or fail to express a proposition at all.

Here's my reading of S above.

Truth-Table for Indicative Conditional (or at least S above):

```
PQS  
TTT  
TFF  
FTF  
FFF  
```

(*Observe*) S is true only if P is true and Q is true.

Reagon [won] only if the Republucans won the election as observed in the article above.

(*Right - Left*) Q only if P

Logical relationship that is ultimately determined by S being a conjunction or a biconditional.

(*claim*) PQS, the Indicative Conditional, is a conjunction or a biconditional in this case. Here, the assertion is just P and Q or P iff Q!  

Exploring other examples. Need to look deeper into the features and structure of that conditional - biconditionals per: https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1216152549
