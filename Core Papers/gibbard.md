(*S*) If the Republicans won the election, Reagan did [won].

(*Indicative*) P => Q

Gibbard asserts that Indicative Conditionals either collapse into the Material Conditional (of classical logic) 
or fail to express a proposition at all.

Here's my reading of S above.

Truth-Table for Indicative Conditional (or at least S above):

PQS
TTT
TFF
FTF
FFF

(*Observe*) S is true only if P is true and Q is true.

Reagon [won] only if the Republucans won the election as observed in the article above.

(*Right - Left*) Q only if P

Logical relationship that is ultimately determined by S being a conjunction.

(*claim*) PQS, the Indicative Conditional, is a conjunction in this case. Here, the assertion is just P and Q!

Exploring other examples.
