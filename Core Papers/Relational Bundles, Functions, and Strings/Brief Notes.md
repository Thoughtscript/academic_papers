1. `Relational Bundle Theory` as a mathematical theory will be renamed `Connection Theory`
2. Better graphical representations will be made.
3. Axioms will be reworked to be cleaner.
4. `Connection Theory` will be a specific implementation of `Relational Bundle Theory` which will remain an ontological proposal.
5. `Connection Theory` will allow a Grand Reduction of our mathematical concepts uniting Set Theory and Category Theory into something altogether more fundamental and with much greater breadth and scope.
