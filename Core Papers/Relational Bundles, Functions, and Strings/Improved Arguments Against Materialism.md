Concise formulations of several arguments against metaphysical materialism.

# General Argument by Ladyman and Ross

1. Metaphysical materialism is inconsistent with our best, current, scientific theories.
1. Methodological naturalism entails consistency with our best, current, scientific theories.

Therefore, metaphysical materialism is not consistent with natural science.

# Higgs Boson - additional argument

1. Metaphysical materialism entails that everything is material (made of matter).
1. The existence of the Higgs Boson entails that matter emerges from the interactions of non-matter-based physical systems.

Therefore, metaphysical materialism is false.

# Quantum Non-locality - partly reprised from Ladyman and Ross

1. Metaphysical materialism entails that the world is made up of tiny material atoms that interact with each other through local kinetic collisions (billard balls).
1. Quantum non-locaity entails that both sub-atomic and atomic particles can interact with each other non-locally through quantum entanglement.

Therefore, metaphysical materialism is false.
