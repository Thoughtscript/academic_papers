# Connection Theory

A philosophical interest that became a mathematical one.

## Some Presuppositions

These are assumed but are not necessarily essential to the project. Most of these are implicitly assumed by people or are uncontroversial:

1. Mathematics involves the close **interaction** between **representation systems** (language, measuring devices, models, etc.) and **patterns** (mathematical relationships). I will remain silent about the exact nature of that **interaction** (a traditional area of inquiry in the epistemology of mathematics) and **patterns** (the metaphysics of math). I will say that the **interaction** is much more tightly knit, **representation systems** are defined by grammatical or procedural rules that delimit the kinds of patterns it can talk about thus, **interaction** need not be understood as a kind of **Fregean correspondance**. It also doesn't collapse the view into Formalism (there are real patterns but they are revealed in language - math is not *just* symbol manipulation). Maybe see Geoffrey Hellman's modal structuralism.
1. If a mathematical theory `T` can be represented fully in another theory `T*`, `T*` is more fundamental than `T`. So, ZFC Set Theory models the Ordinals used for basic Number Theory and Peano Arithematic. It can model and describe almost everything else in math too. As such, it's usually taken to be most fundamental. Category Theory is the other big contender here.
1. Relationships (relations) are the broadest taxonomic label. Functions, Mappings, Morphims, Equivalence, etc. are all Relations.

## Core Goals

1. To create a language system that is diagrammatic (like Feynman Diagrams and Category Theory) and so, easy to use. This is a new trend that is quite exciting.
1. That the language system is mathematical expressive - able to talk about and represent mathematical concepts that present language systems can already talk about.
1. The primary representational building block is not a word or noun but `relationships between relations`.
1. To support the project of Ontic Structural Realism in the Philosophy of Science - it's not "everything's interconnected" it's "there are only connections not things" - the world we experience is conveniently structured by the brain but, ultimately, it's just relationships. There's some known difficulties with this view not least of which is that our entire known language is pretty-much noun-focused (object-centric). So, and this is very primal UR shit, we're creating a nounless language really - though the exact ability to translate these into something coherent in say English is, obviously, very difficult.
1. Interesting new perspectives on identity and equivalence. Nounless or structural identities mean what? Are relations identified as having an intrinsic, free-standing identity, or only in-virtue of the relations in which they stand? Since these two approaches indicate the same relation, are the identity mappings equivalent? What does that mean? That "something" can be greater than itself?

Traditionally, there are three basic fundamental ontological categories that everything else is one or more of:

1. **Object** / **Thing** / **Entity** / **Individuals** / **Substances** - The reference of a noun word or name. A square, a cat, the paradigmatic philosophical atom of Democritus. The person the word "Democritus" (a proper noun) refers to. A monad in Leibniz's system. The universe. Etc. Individual here usually means "specific item" rather than "person" (though "persons" are usually understood to "individuals" in both senses).
1. **Property** / **Attribute** / **Characteristic** / **Universals**- a feature or attribute of an object. Some people think that objects are just properties or that objects are a special kind of property (*haecceity*) into which other properties "stick into like a pin-cushion".
1. **Relationships** / **Relations** - A relationship is usually taken to be something that obtains between two or more objects. A cup rests on a table. Mary is the wife of Tom. 1 + 1 = 2.

Universals (Forms) are "everything" - Plato.

Atoms (Objects) are "everything" - Democritus.

Relationships (which create patterns or structures) are "everything" - Ontic Struturalism. Surprisingly, this is truly a new view in philosophy. As in the history of philosophy. Some precusors. Claims about the incoherence of it really just amount to difficulties getting the idea to conception and clarity (which all the other views had centuries to do) in my opinion.

## Basic Axioms

I've tried to improve the terminology to make it less confusing. 

**Connectors** - Roughly, a relationship (relation) building block. They come in four varieties:

1. Open undirected - open String (of String Theory), etc.
1. Closed undirected - identity morphism, automorphism, etc.
1. Open directed - etc. 
1. Closed directed - identity morphism, automorphism, etc.

Previously, Relational Bundle Theory lacked the ability to have free-standing **Connectors** as well as **Closed directed** ones (though it could partially model that).

Formally, a **Connector** is a **Connection-less** **Connection**. It has no **Connections** itself though it is a a **Connection**.

**Connections** - Roughly, a relationship (relation). Four varieties.

1. Open undirected - symmetric relationships, etc.
1. Closed undirected - identity morphism, automorphism, etc.
1. Open directed - ordering relations, transitive relations, etc. 
1. Closed directed - identity morphism, automorphism, etc.

Formally, a **Connection** is a **Connection** with **Connectors**.

## Expressive Power

So, we can get Categories, Ordinals, Sets (both *wff* and not *wff*), etc.

## Interesting Geometric Properties

Coming from a design (with pixel representations of language characters) and front-end background, I have a new-found interest in the geometry of language (which has mostly been studied from a purely generative grammar - or mathematical logic - sort of perspective). Given that Connection Theory leverages diagrams (but is not to be confused with the Graphs of Graph Theory which rely on sets defined into edges and vertices and need not be represented diagrammatically at all) there are some interesting, probably planar geometric properties that could further expand and formalize the theory.

I'm also very interested in G. Spencer-Brown's The Laws of Form.
