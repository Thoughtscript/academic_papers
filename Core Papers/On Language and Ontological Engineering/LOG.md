# The Language of God (**3DL**)

Updated: 11.14.18  
Status: Draft  

## Summary

“The Language of God” - What a "God's-eye" ("Eagle's-eye" if you prefer) view would look like. Perhaps something like (but still far inferior from) a way in which would communicate from such a vantage-point.

## Use Cases

**Metaphysical Linguism** - The doctrine that there are only *language systems*. Language systems do not frame metaphysical debates, rather metaphysics (the study of reality) is ultimately the study of *language systems*. I will discuss further what a *language system* such that the immediate incredulity that this thesis yields falls away.

**Simple hierglyphic-like** writing language.

**Clarifying some ways of thinking about metaphysics** in philosophy.

***Rechender Raum***.

## Survey

These are the building blocks of **3DL**:

1. **Predicates** or **Type** - A pre-defined list of Euclidean geometric structures.
1. **Spaces** - 3-Dimensional Euclidean **Spaces** here.
1. **Instances** - A "copy" or instantiation of a **Predicate** located in a **Space**.
1. **Propositions** - Temporal ordering of concatenated **Spaces** - a 4-Dimensional world line.

A **Predicate**, a **Type**, is a 3-Dimensional entity which is instanced by being placed into a 3-Dimensional **Space**. 

For those familiar with philosophical metaphysics or those familiar software tools like AutoCAD (where a GUI where pattern **Types** are “dragged onto” a canvas to create a specific “copy”).

In this language, people communicate by concatenating sequences of **Spaces** forming **Propositions**.

Each 3-Dimensional **Space** is a set of 2-Dimensional pointless topologies. Each 2-Dimensional space is written using ***Connection Theory***.

Tense is captured by natural orderings (temporal sequences) of each 3-Dimensional **Space**.

## Formalization

Formally, the **lexicon** of **3DL**:

1. **Types**: 

1. **Instances**: **Instances** are **Type** copies positioned or situated in a **Space**.

1. **Spaces**: **Spaces** are concatenated into sequences which form natural **Temporal Orderings**.

- A **Frame of Reference** is a set of **Propositions** or **Temporal Orderings**.


The **grammar** of **3DL**:




The **semantics** of **3DL**:

The truth of a **Proposition** *P* is given by its *invariance* with or *isomorphism* to other **Propositions** *R*, *Q*, *N*, ...
