# Information Warfare Concerns

This brief article summarizes a few critical concerns regarding the potential use of information by enemy powers to destabilize the United States in the following ways: (1) reduce trust between citizens and institutions, (2) increase polarisation, division, and radicalization, (3) increase the difficulty in citizens and institutions accessing good information, (4) and direct harm to mental health and well-being.

Some of these are known and are being addressed. It is the hope of this brief article to further explicate some of these concerns so that they may be better remedied.

# Trust Reduction and Enhancement: Trust Adjustment

Warfare since the 1960's has repeatedly demonstrated the effectiveness of *soft power* methods in winning military conflicts. In otherwords, the allegiance, ideologies, cultural affinities, morale, loyalty, and willingness to fight (rather than the raw military might in terms of bullets, guns, tanks, etc.) of an entire population (rather than a particular assemblage of military units *alone*) plays a significant role and largely determines the outcome of armed conflict in the long-run however successful initial military operations might be.

Soft power leveraged to enhance or reduce trust between elements of composite social organization plays an essential role in state building, cohension, and intercooperation. Information that targets specific elements of society repeatedly and over-time can therefore play an important role in reducing or improving trust.

While the recent fiasco with social media being used as a platform for enemy intelligence agencies has received much coverage there has been little in the way of solvency (remedy) or providing counter-reduction methods (ameliorating such determintal news with positive news).

# Beware Divide and Conquer

*Divide et impera* is a military strategy dating back to at least late antiquity. The challenge for a single ruler over a large population with many factions is thus, "How do I alone compel this mass to obey me? How do I maintain my rule over this mass of people when I am a single person?" *Divide and Conquer* is just such a strategy - segmenting society, creating artificial divisions or exacerbating existing ones, and atomizing previously united groups into rivalrous subgroups guided by fierce and fractitious personalities.

In the same way that smaller military units can defeat much larger ones through *defeat in detail* whereby two military units x, y exist such that the numerical strength, *num*, of x is less than the numerical strength of y but each subgroup of y is strictly numerically less than y or:

	(DID) A *defeat in detail* potentiality exists between x, y *if*:
			
		(i) num(x) < num(y); and
		(b) for all z of subgroup(y): num(z) < num(x)

Strictly speaking, there are more opportunities for **defeat in detail** beyond mere numerical superiority. Hence, the use conditional 'if' and not the strict logical equivalence 'if and only if'.

In a democracy, the application of such techniques by **enemy** foreign powers is doubly worrisome. A democracy obtains its legitimacy from the will of the people - by assent and agreement through the process of mutual compact - evident in many crucial areas of the political body: deliberation, freedom of speech (which is not merely the act of solipsistic solilquy but, particularly in tandem with the right to assembly, a dialouge), voting, judicial review, trial by jury, etc.

# Information Asymmetries

We may define *information symmetry* per the following:

	(IS) A person *x* is *symmetric* with respect to a person *y* for some information *i* *iff*:

		(a) 
		(b)
		(c)

By "cluttering up" information symmetries so that information because lopsided through obfuscation, deliberate misinformation, reduction of quality tools to find information, etc.

Some but not all internet trolls are likely to be (a) fictious persons used by (b) foreign agents to intimidate, harass, and attack vulnerable and news-getting persons. This has the
