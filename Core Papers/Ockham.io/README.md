# README.md - 8.15.18

For the foreseeable future, updates to the **Ockham.io** open-source proposal will be maintained elsewhere. 

Once the final draft and submission is prepared it will be released in its entirety.

### Deadlines

TA3 deadline is Nov. 1st with teams being accepted through Dec. 12th (https://twitter.com/DARPA/status/1027529296854822912).

### Other Objectives

Regarding funding: We will likely be requesting bare-minimum funding (to maintain repo, minimal logistics support, bug bounty incentives).

Many DARPA projects can exceed $400,000-$700,000 in funding. We can contribute this project at a fraction of a fraction of that.

We hope to launch some kind of ICO to incentivize use, ensure the long-term existence and continual improvement of the project, reward bug bounties or other kinds of identified methodological issues. 

We would also, ideally, like to make this a profitable venture for the U.S. tax-payer by returning any initial funding (and a bit more) using any ICO assets to fund a kind of non-profit arrangement *in perpetuity*.

### Open Source

All resources here will be made publicly open-sourced and will gladly be shared with other teams.

We will also be building a full-fledged web application service providing API endpoints useful to researchers and families that will leverage these open-source tools and algorithms.
