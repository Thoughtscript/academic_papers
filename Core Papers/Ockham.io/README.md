This is an as yet still somewhat nascent approach but I do think it a good start. The attached abstract and full proposal will explicate some of the specific details of implementation. 

Organization-wise, I'm happy to coordinate this as an open-source endeavor and to work with other teams to accomplish the same purpose. I'm also happy to defer and contribute these resources (including the domain-name) to a wider project or open-source effort.

In terms of technical talent, where I lack specific areas of expertise, the companies I work for do in abundance and can be called upon to assist as needed.

Given the open-source nature of the project, it's possible this could be inexpensive (I'm certainly not seeking funding by myself). But, any ancillary project might incur expenses. Additionally any sort of bug-bounty or monetary incentive could incur limited costs. For example, it's possible to use cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) to incentive the project (without an ICO). I can, for example, build a simple token and the project could at some point become blockchain-based and again fully transparent and public in that way. Details attached.
