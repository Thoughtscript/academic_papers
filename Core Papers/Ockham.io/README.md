# README.md - 8.15.18

For the foreseeable future, updates to the Ockham.io open-source proposal will be maintained elsewhere. 

Once the final draft and submission is prepared it will be released in its entirety.

TA3 deadline is Nov. 1st with teams being accepted through Dec. 12th (https://twitter.com/DARPA/status/1027529296854822912).

**Other Objectives:** Request bare-minimum funding (to maintain repo, minimal logistics support, bug bounty incentives).

Many projects can exceed $400,000-$700,000 in funding. We can contribute this project at a fraction of that.

All resources here will be made publicly open-sourced, but a full-fledged web application will also be maintained. 

We hope to launch some kind of ICO to incentivize use, ensure the long-term existence and continual improvement of the project, reward bug bounties or other kinds of methodological issues.

We would also, ideally, like to make this a profitable venture for the U.S. tax-payer by returning any initial funding (and a bit more) using any ICO assets to fund a kind of non-profit arrangement in perpetuity.
