Additional Desiderata:

1. T-Scheme should be analytic.
1. The solution should be the most parsimonious relative to its alternatives. 
    * The solution should involve as few additional theoretical assumptions as possible to successfully address the problem.
    * Additional assumptions about reference, context, language, semantics, and so on are calculated as costs since the truth of the solution is also contingent on the truth of these other theories.
1. The solution should identify the root of the problem not just for the liar paradox but for all alethic paradox.
1. The solution should be cohere maximally with other theories. It should be as theory-agnostic as possible in line with [2].
1. The solution should provide an effective procedure or algorithm to mathematical define the class of problematic expressions.
    We note that the meta liar ('the liar sentence is truth' is truth) also runs afoul of alethic paradox.
1. The solution should apply equally well to semantically closed and unclosed languages.
1. The solution should solve all alethic paradox, including Yablo and Revenge.

==============================================================================

1. Classical instability - is classical instability a strike against the theory? 
    * Doesn't it provide mathematical and structural support for the empirical observation that people have diverging views about the liar paradox?
    * Wouldn't a true theory capture that empirical observation?* No other theory set does that.
    * And no small wonder since we're all using classical logic in our metalogic used in these debates.
1. Analytic - if T-Scheme is indeed analytic (which everyone but most restrictionists believes) then so is the restricted T-Scheme.
1. Consistency Proof and Truth in all models proves analyticity as well.
1. The restricted T-Scheme debate shifts inquiry to the proper area of focus, which sentences does the T-Scheme apply to (a non-restrictionist says all)?
    * If T-Scheme exists in a language L then so does P -> T-Scheme.
    * This solution piggy-backs any other theory. The moment C is added to a language so this, Truth-Grounding theory emerges in it. See the bullet-point above.

Truth-grounding, here, involves a privilged set of sentences from which derived true sentences can come from. In sentential logic, propositions compose sentences (containing the logical connectives).
