# TG Update - 12.30.18

* A **grounded** sentence *S* for a language *L* is a sentence with a specified property *P* to serve as the foundation or starting point for a procedure, operation, or use.

* **Truth-grounding** is formally defined as specifying a set of sentences (not necessarily *wff*) satisfactory for our theory of truth.

* A algorithm to define the set of **truth-grounded** sentences is defined. Call this **TGA**.

Note: **TGA** is finite since every sentence in *L* is finite.

## Observations

What about diagonalization? To which sentences does this method apply? What are the appropriate constraints?

Presently, by *unrestricted diagonalization*, we find:

1. S =df ~S
1. S =df Q
1. S =df R
1. R =df ~S

and so on.

This is problematic. Perhaps the problems lies less with CL, T-Scheme, or our meta-logical concepts (i.e. - metalogic, object logic) but rather with the constraints on assignment and use of *name-forming operators* and sentences.

That's great since there's little discussion on that in the literature (i.e. - "an adequate name-forming operator") and an opportunity to clarify our logical concepts.

## Thoughts

Thus, we may combine the **TGA** with improved constraints on the selected *name-forming operator* in order to potentially provide a cleaner classical solution.

This is not only of significant mathematical interst but of great philosophical interest as well (naming baptisms, Kripke's *On Naming and Necessity*, etc.).
