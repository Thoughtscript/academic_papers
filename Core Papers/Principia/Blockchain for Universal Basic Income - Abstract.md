**Description**: *For “Blockchain Summit” in Seattle on September 24 - 25, 2018,* 

**Tentatively**: *"Blockchain for Universal Basic Income: Blockchain and the New Economy"*

A universally supported public blockchain (and supported by loans or grants) could provide robust security improvements, help to reduce income inequality, help to reduce technological hardware inequality, provide moderate passive income, offset public infrastructure costs (like criminal records, driver's licenses, license plates, mailing addresses) in a really transparent way, provide a universal pre-banking option so everyone is connected to improved payment options, and be a massive job creator (hardware, IT, server admin).

"If every family in the United States (and beyond) received a $2500 grant or loan to build a modern crypto-currency-mining-able desktop right now..."

Current payoff is about 18 months to 24 months (or slightly more) for one GPU. From an asset ROI, that's great! Most hedge funds return 7%-17% a year. Even at today's really depressed prices, we're looking at around a 50% ROI.
