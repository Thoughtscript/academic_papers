Notes.

Definition:

1. *Economy of Abundance* - Defined here to mean an economic and political arrangement under which all human *needs* are met. Scarcity remains as a practical feature of human live. Yet, all human needs are met (there is exactly the amount of supply to meet demand).
1. *Post-Money Society* - Defined here to mean an economic system not dependent on currency systems that are proxies for exchanging, meeting, or receiving human needs.

The definitions above slightly vary from the norm.

## Approach One: Total Self-Reliance 

**Not economic autarky** - individual scarcity met by individual self-sufficiency

A condition under which an *economy of abundance* is met because each person fully meets their own needs. Not through trade, barter, or exchange.

Example: a future person has their own 3D factory, their own mining robot, their own water well, their own solar power unit, their own hydroponics garden, etc. such that they are largely self-contained (fix any of their own items, feed themselves, etc.).

## Approach Two: Increasing 



## Approach Three: Effective Labor Units and Energy Supply



## Generalizing Approaches





## Needs and Wants





## Debt Nullification and Exchange



## Pro-Social Credits
