# 1.18.19

Notes.

Definition:

1. *Economy of Abundance* - Defined here to mean an economic and political arrangement under which all human *needs* are met. Scarcity remains as a practical feature of human live. Yet, all human needs are met (there is exactly the amount of supply to meet demand).
1. *Post-Money Society* - Defined here to mean an economic system not dependent on currency systems that are proxies for exchanging, meeting, or receiving human needs.

The definitions above slightly vary from the norm.

## Approach One: Total Self-Reliance 

**Not economic autarky** - individual scarcity met by individual self-sufficiency

A condition under which an *economy of abundance* is met because each person fully meets their own needs. Not through trade, barter, or exchange. Also *Post-Money Society*.

Example: a future person has their own 3D factory, their own mining robot, their own water well, their own solar power unit, their own hydroponics garden, etc. such that they are largely self-contained (fix any of their own items, feed themselves, etc.).

## Approach Two: Valuation-Objects and Systems-of-Value

A condition under which an *economy of abundance* is met because each person relies upon and receives stakes in a universal system of production, service, and exchange. System is not meant in a vague abstract sort of way. 

It means an implemented programmatic distributed service (like blockchain) that processes all transactions, stores all persistent data, and runs necessary programming operations on machines. 

Each person has a stake in the system and receives further stakes in the system as they perform certain tasks. Stakes increase inherently so more can be done with each stake over time.

Abstraction of an overall productive, growing, economy (equities in companies, companies producing increasing value, companies expanding through further available capital, and so on).

Not a *Post-Money Society*.

## Approach Three: Effective Labor Units and Energy Supply

Closed loop automated manufacturing - robots mine, robots transport, robots build and repair other robots. Practically infinite energy to enable that to happen. Humans oversee as needed (to bring it about and later on to adjust and manage).

Robots are defined here into *labor units*.  Assuming that their are enough *labor units* to meet all human needs, the system obtains an *economy of abudance*.

Consider when the Fat Fingers Problem is overcome in Nanotech and ITER goes active with 10x fusion energy.

## Generalizing Approaches

...

## Needs and Wants

Needs would be universally met through the various new tools, concepts, and technological advances.

Wants would be met through further pro-social behavior (enshrined as a kind of Karma).

## Debt Nullification and Exchange

Existing debts could be exchanged into an intermediate point system that would allow a range of wants to be met (but perhaps in a more restrictive way than the Karma mentioned above).


## Pro-Social Credits

Rewards for advancements, services, innovations, optimizations, problem-solving, etc. that would be beneficial to all people. Could be quantifiable (strictly benefiting some people but not all would give less than strictly benefiting all people, the degree of benefit, and so on). Karma does not need to be numerical it could be mereological as articulated elsewhere in this repo.
