# MUH Semantics for Modal Logic

Sketch of a Modal Logical semantics using MUH and Algebraic structures:

(1) Accessibility - ordering is done up-to-isomorphism - that is, by weaker to stronger morphisms rather than a set-theoretic relation constructed through set-theoretic extensions - this creates a Space.

(2) Truth satisfaction is given by the algebraic structure - greater variation of structures - Kripke Frame supports the limited notion of a set of Worlds - they have no internal structure save for being a set of Facts. Robust algebraic structures replace such opaque or limited set-theretic objects.

(3) More accurately models the MUH proposal while prescinding from the thornier ontological debates - Actuality as a strongly weighted region of a Field rather than a meta-linguistic predicate - what gives this weight assignment: (A) the truth of sentences at a local region and (B) the existence of sentences at that region.
