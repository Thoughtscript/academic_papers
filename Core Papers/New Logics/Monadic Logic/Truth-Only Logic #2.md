Truth-only logic - consider a Many-Valued Logic: [0, 1] we map our wff to [0,1] and every wff is assigned a numeric truth value that is in that interval.

Consider a Truth-only logic:

1. Truth*
2. TruthN
3. TruthN-1
...

Here, T* has TruthN as a proper subset. We map our wff to T* and every wff is assigned an element of the subsets of T*.

Truth* need not be infinite in cardinality. If Truth* has a cardinality of X there exists a Many-Valued logic isomorphic to the Truth-only Logic* with the following properties:

1. {X, X1, X2, ..., XN, X*} 
2. Where every X of the set in 1. is a subset of the following member save for X* and N is equal to the cardinality - 1.

This is a dimensional logic as described.

Philosophically, there's a huge distinction between this and Fregean or traditional true/false conceptions of logic. On this perspective there are inferior truths and superior truths (in amount, accuracy, detail, etc.). Metaphorically, instead of a line seperating truth and untruth (Frege's truth-bifurcation) or the Laws of Form (which works with the fundamental notion of difference distinction) captured in the negation symbol or overlaid boxes, here we would have a dot and a line (with many shorter lines between).
