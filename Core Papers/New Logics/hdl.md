# Quick Notes

One Dimensional Logic (not to be confused with predicate quantification or so called higher-order logics):

(1) One layer - layer approach pertains to number of wrapping logics  
(2)	{T, F} or {0, 1} - one criterion for semantic evaluation  

Two Dimensional Logic:

(1) Two layers (one wrapping) <- convienent rewriting of Meta and Object language relationships  
(2) {T, F} or {0, 1} and V <- two requirements for truth-aptness. More stringent truth-conditions

Semantics for Hyper-Dimensional Topological Logic

We define a hdtl a per:

df-1: Let L1, L2 be two logics such that L2 is the Higher Dimensional Logic for L1.

df-2: Let the set of propositions P of each logic L be mapped by a function F to a topological space S such that:

df-a: For every S1, S2 mapped to S any logical connective C such that CS1S2 is also mapped to S.

df-b: F ...


df-c: For ...


df-3: A HDL L2 for L1 is such that:

(i). There exist some T for every Truth Assignment (Interpretation I) such that no propositional stability exists to map L1 propositions to L2's Truth Conditions.

(ii). Every Truth Assignment A for L1 is so assigned to L2 though each of L2's propositional Truth Assignments are strict supersets of those assigned to the corresponding L1 proposition.

Tarskian meta/object distinction satisfies conditions for this whenever Truth Predicate S in L2 does not exist in L1 and the T-Scheme holds as a bridge axiom in the meta-logic.


df-4: ...



E.G. -

```
S1 in L1 is T
S1 in L2 is T and •
S1 in L3 is T and • and !
```

This creates a regimented but untyped hierarchy for Mathematical Logic.

This demonstrates a specific advantageous use case for non-stable propositions.

Changing the the truth assignment for a lower dimensional mapping modifies the truth assignment of all higher dimensional logics.

But modifying the truth of higher dimensional truth assignment doesn't modify the truth of the lower ones necessarily.

A *lower dimensional* approach would see regimentations of Truth Assignments such for every level n+1 over n, there are one or more fewer  conjuncts for the truth assignment mappings and as such no lower order truth modification necessitates change of truth at a higher dimension.

The number of *higher order dimensions* existing above S1 is the powerset of truth conjuncts with the additional constraint that the cardinality of each element must be less than the initial cardinality of the permutated set.

E.g.  -

```
S1 in L1 is T and * and • and !
S1 in L2 is T and * and •
S1 in L3 is T and *
```

Levels metaphor (and some/all mathematical abstraction) as higher-dimensional or lower dimensional systems - e.g. supervenience which is implemented above.
