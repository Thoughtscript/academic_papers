One Dimensional Logic (not to be confused with predicate quantification or so called higher-order logics):

(1) One layer - layer approach pertains to number of wrapping logics
(2)	{T, F} or {0, 1} - one criterion for semantic evaluation

Two Dimensional Logic:

(1) Two layers (one wrapping) <- convienent rewriting of Meta and Object language relationships
(2) {T, F} or {0, 1} and V <- two requirements for truth-aptness. More stringent truth-conditions

E.g. - ...
