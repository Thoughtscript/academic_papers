## Academic Works - Articles

**Alethic Paradox**:
```
* Truth Grounding and the Liar 
```
A short paper that uniquely identifies the syntactic cause for Alethic Paradox, provides an algorithm to do so, demonstrates a class of philosophical solutions satisfactory for that, provides a consistency proof for Kripke-Feferman satisfying the four intuitions about Alethic Paradox as well as the empirical observation that most people never apply T-Schema to the Liar Sentence.

Additional comments (pending): relationship to sub-structural approaches, solutions that can implement and gain from the formal edifice provided, etc.

**Relational Bundles**:
```
* Relational Bundles and Eliminative Ontic Structural Realism 
```
A decisive defense of Eliminative Ontic Structural Realism and articulation of a new language for mathematical activity sufficient for Category Theory, Graph Theory, String Theory, and the Ordinals.

```
* Connection Theory
```
An improved formulation of `Relational Bundle Theory` which is sufficient to represent the familiar mathematical objects/entities `Ordinals`, `Sets`, `Lattices`, `Graphs`, and `Categories`. The building blocks are `relations` from which `Mappings` and `Functions` can be derived from.

```
* Strings, Lines, Loops, Dimensions, Relational Bundles 
```
A paper building off the preceding one in articulating a philosophical defense of Strings and relation-based ontology. Constructions of Space and Time using pointless topologies.

**Gödel's Ontological Proof**:
```
* Comments on Gödel's Ontological Proof
```
Nietzsche and property definitions for Gödel's Ontological Proof.

**Hyper Dimensional Logics**:
```
* Hyper Dimensional Logics
```
I explore spatial and dimensional representations of logic extending my analysis to *n* dimensions. Along the way we'll investigate questions of symmetry, disputation/argument, and how logics in higher-dimensions may "reach down" and override lower-dimensional arguments.

**Tegmark's *Mathematical Universe Hypothesis***:
```
* Writing Sample
```
I argue against Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis by analyzing several major underlying assumptions. Despite strictly rejecting the MUH, I argue that there are major problems with the alternative and that we need to blend these two into a better hierarchy of ontological concepts.

**Mathematical Ontology/Ontological Engineering**:
```
* Mathematical Ontology
```
Discussion surrounding alternating *constructive* methods with *classical* methods. Justification, in part, for the Relational Bundle Ontology.
```
* Structure Constrained Ontology
```
Old paper discussing the relationship of Truth, phenomena, and Models. I argue that there is no symbol grounding - our concepts, language, and linguistic frameworks are implicitly united. There are only relationships between linguistic modalities.
```
* An Ontology of Language
```
Traditionally, we've taken the view that ontology is essential to language. I present an ontology of linguistic items that flips this conception on its head.

**Automated Philosophy**:
```
* Automated Philosophy
```
White paper articulating The Ontological Engine. A system for generating novel philosophy ideas. Used in the creation of new logical innovations (below).

**Logical Innovations**:
```
* Transactional Logic
```
I define a Transactional Logic and demonstrate its practical applications tracking truth between different non-modal logics, use for identifying blackboxed AI.
```
* On Words and Propositions
```
I define propositional abstraction and demonstrate its applicability to logic and linguistics. Propositional abstraction utilizes `inner semantics` as opposed to the metaphor of semantic webs. Truth-conditions, for formal propositions, can be verified without recourse to external semantical objects like models or structures.

**Defense**:
```
* Information Warfare Concerns
```
A short paper suggesting a few techniques and remedies to help assuage information security woes.

```
* Ockham
```
A short DARPA RFI outlining a general approach to automatically screening Social Science research.
