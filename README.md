## Academic Works - Articles

**Alethic Paradox**:
```
* Truth Grounding and the Liar 
```
A short paper that uniquely identifies the syntactic cause for Alethic Paradox, provides an algorithm to do so, demonstrates a class of philosophical solutions satisfactory for that, provides a consistency proof for Kripke-Feferman satisfying the four intuitions about Alethic Paradox as well as the empirical observation that most people never apply T-Schema to the Liar Sentence.

Additional comments (pending): relationship to sub-structural approaches, solutions that can implement and gain from the formal edifice provided, etc.

**Relational Bundles**:
```
* Relational Bundles and Eliminative Ontic Structural Realism 
```
A decisive defense of Eliminative Ontic Structural Realism and articulation of a new language for mathematical activity sufficient for `Category Theory`, `Graph Theory`, `String Theory`, and the `Ordinals`.

The original paper demonstrates not only the coherence of a philosophical position deemed incoherent but also how it can be distilled into a diagram (à la C.S. Pierce's Existential Graphs or Feynman's Quantum Field Diagrams).

```
* Connection Theory
```
An improved formulation of `Relational Bundle Theory` which is sufficient to represent the familiar mathematical objects/entities `Ordinals`, `Sets`, `Lattices`, `Graphs`, and `Categories`. The building blocks are `Relations` from which `Mappings` and `Functions` can be derived from.

This is no mere collection of arrows but an increasingly precise mathematical theory with substantial philosophical underpinnings.

Eventual planar geometric relationships will be explored that will help to further explicate important relationships between sign, content, and meaning (as studied in Semiotics).

```
* Strings, Lines, Loops, Dimensions, Relational Bundles 
```
A paper building off the preceding one in articulating a philosophical defense of Strings and relation-based ontology. Constructions of Space and Time using pointless topologies.

It was pointed out to me that many of the original formlations of RBT (above) are relevant to advances in String Theory and to Feynman Diagrams.

Points are notoriously difficult entities that cause major paradoxes and conceptual woes throughout the philosophy of mathematics, physics, geometry, and even within politics (consider the "Pathetic Dot"). Along the way, I will hope to articulate why this alternative metaphor better serves us in math and other areas.

**Gödel's Ontological Proof**:
```
* Comments on Gödel's Ontological Proof
```
Nietzsche and property definitions for Gödel's Ontological Proof.

I specify one property in particular: `supercoming` whereby a *positive* property that were it to not exist, will come to.

**Modal Logic Semantics**:
```
* Algebraic Objects and Possible World Semantics
```
I explore utilizing (mixed) algebraic structures over Kripke frames alone. 

**Hyper Dimensional Logics**:
```
* Hyper Dimensional Logics
```
I explore spatial and dimensional representations of logic extending my analysis to *n* dimensions. Along the way we'll investigate questions of symmetry, disputation/argument, and how logics in higher-dimensions may "reach down" and override lower-dimensional arguments.

1. A *many-valued* system of logic contains *n-many* truth-values.
2. An *n-dimensional* logic contains *n-many* truth conditions.
3. An *hyper-dimensional* logic orders these logics akin to well-understood type theories so that truth-values in higher logics supervene on truth-values of lower ones and vice-versa.  

This has potential applications for security, defense, robotic obedience, and metaphysics.

**Tegmark's *Mathematical Universe Hypothesis***:
```
* Writing Sample
```
I argue against Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis by analyzing several major underlying assumptions. Despite strictly rejecting the MUH, I argue that there are major problems with the alternative and that we need to blend these two into a better hierarchy of ontological concepts.

**Mathematical Ontology/Ontological Engineering**:
```
* Mathematical Ontology
```
Discussion surrounding alternating *constructive* methods with *classical* methods. Justification, in part, for the Relational Bundle Ontology.

Careful attention will be given to Brading and Landry's observation that mathematical theories typically invoke one of two kinds of "existence" postulates and how these might relate to *constructive* and *classical* methods in foundations.

Lastly, some comments regarding Carnap's Logical Frameworks will be discussed in light of this. There are, in fact, two kinds of mathematical existence employed.

```
* Structure Constrained Ontology
```
Old paper discussing the relationship of Truth, phenomena, and Models. I argue that there is no symbol grounding - our concepts, language, and linguistic frameworks are implicitly united. There are only relationships between linguistic modalities.
```
* An Ontology of Language
```
Traditionally, we've taken the view that ontology is essential to language. I present an ontology of linguistic items that flips this conception on its head.

**Automated Philosophy**:
```
* Automated Philosophy
```
White paper articulating The Ontological Engine. A system for generating novel philosophy ideas. Used in the creation of new logical innovations (below).

**Logical Innovations**:
```
* Transactional Logic
```
I define a Transactional Logic and demonstrate its practical applications tracking truth between different non-modal logics, use for identifying blackboxed AI.
```
* On Words and Propositions
```
I define propositional abstraction and demonstrate its applicability to logic and linguistics. Propositional abstraction utilizes `inner semantics` as opposed to the metaphor of semantic webs. Truth-conditions, for formal propositions, can be verified without recourse to external semantical objects like models, shifts in conventional meaning, or structures insulating meaning from semantic drift.

**Defense and Law**:
```
* Information Warfare Concerns
```
A short paper suggesting a few techniques and remedies to help assuage information security woes.

```
* Between Life and Death: Cryogenics and Capital Punishment
```
I argue that using cryogenic freezing is strictly more ethical than killing in cases of capital punishment.

If the person to be executed is innocent:

1. They cannot be wrongfully killed, they are merely preserved in a suspended state.
2. They can be unfrozen.

If the person to be executed is guilty:

1. That person remains suspended permanently.

```
* Ockham.io
```
A short DARPA RFI outlining a general approach to automatically screening Social Science research using compact algebraic structures to vastly simplify the process of verifying research.
