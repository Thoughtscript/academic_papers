## Original Works

Alethic Paradox:
```
* Truth Grounding and the Liar 

	A short paper that uniquely identifies the linguistic cause for Alethic Paradox, demonstrates a class of philosophical solutions satisfactory for that, provides a consistency proof for Kripke-Feferman satisfying the four intuitions about Alethic Paradox as well as the empirical observation that most people never apply T-Schema to the Liar Sentence.
```

Relational Bundles:
```
* Relational Bundles and Eliminative Ontic Structural Realism 

	A decisive defense of Eliminative Ontic Structural Realism and articulation of a new language for mathematical activity sufficient for Category Theory, Graph Theory, String Theory, and the Ordinals.

* Strings, Lines, Loops, Dimensions, Relational Bundles 

	A paper building off the preceding one in articulating a philosophical defense of Strings and relation-based ontology. Constructions of Space and Time using pointless topologies.
